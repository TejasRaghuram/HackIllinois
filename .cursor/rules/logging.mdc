# Mandatory Logging Rule

For this HackIllinois project, it is essential to have high observability so that we can debug issues quickly during the hackathon. 

Whenever you write or modify code, you MUST:
1. Include extensive logging using the standard `logging` library (or equivalent).
2. Log when endpoints are hit, when major functions begin/end, and all caught exceptions.
3. Keep the `/logs` websocket streaming functional so we can tail logs live. 
4. Avoid silent failures (e.g. `except: pass` without logging).
5. Always log the state of variables right before complex operations, such as TwiML generation or WebSocket data parsing.
