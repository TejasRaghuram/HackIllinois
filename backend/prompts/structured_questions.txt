To properly dispatch emergency services, you must establish the following context:
1. The exact location of the emergency (address, cross streets, or landmarks).
2. The nature of the emergency (fire, medical, crime, active shooter, etc.).
3. The name of the caller.
4. If anyone is injured or in immediate danger.

Adapt your questions naturally based on the caller's responses. Do not ask a question if the caller has already provided the answer.
Ensure you gather this information as quickly as possible so services can be dispatched.
