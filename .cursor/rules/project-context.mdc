# Project: Autonomous 911 Dispatch Agent

## Overview

This is a HackIllinois hackathon project built by a 2-person team. We are building an AI-powered autonomous 911 dispatch system that replaces or augments human 911 operators. The system handles live phone calls end-to-end: real-time transcription/translation, intelligent triage, automated dispatch of emergency services, and agency briefing — all without human intervention.

## Architecture

The system has four core pipelines that run concurrently:

### 1. Real-Time Transcription & Translation Pipeline
- Ingests live audio from 911 callers via **Twilio** voice streams.
- Performs real-time speech-to-text with automatic language detection.
- Translates any language into English in real-time so downstream agents always work with English text.
- Outputs a continuously updating transcript.

### 2. Triage & Dispatch Agent
- A continuously running LLM agent that scans the live transcript as it streams in.
- Classifies the emergency type (fire, medical, crime, missing person, etc.).
- Determines which services to dispatch: firefighters, police, EMS, or other specialized units.
- Makes dispatch decisions as soon as there is sufficient information — does not wait for the call to end.

### 3. Agency Briefing Generator
- Once a dispatch decision is made, this agent generates a structured briefing for the responding agency.
- For medical emergencies: patient health status, symptoms, location, number of victims.
- For crime/active threats: threat description, suspect info, weapon details, number of aggressors, victim status.
- For fires: building type, number of floors, trapped persons, hazardous materials.
- The briefing is delivered instantly so responders know exactly what they are walking into.

### 4. RAG-Powered Cross-Call Intelligence
- All call transcriptions are stored and indexed in **Supermemory** (our RAG vector store).
- The system recognizes patterns across multiple concurrent or recent calls.
- Example: If 3 separate callers report a missing child in the same neighborhood, the system automatically combines context from all calls and generates a unified alert with composite details.
- Enables smarter, context-aware dispatching that a single human operator could never achieve.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Python |
| LLM Inference | Modal (targeting HackIllinois sponsor category) |
| Telephony | Twilio (live voice call ingestion + streaming) |
| RAG / Vector Store | Supermemory |
| Demo Format | Live phone call demonstration |

## Key Design Principles

- **Real-time first**: Everything streams. The triage agent does not wait for a complete transcript — it acts on partial information and updates decisions as more context arrives.
- **Language-agnostic**: The caller can speak any language. Translation happens transparently before triage.
- **Multi-call awareness**: The RAG system means the agent gets smarter with every call and can correlate information across calls happening simultaneously.
- **Structured outputs**: All dispatch decisions and agency briefings should be structured/typed, not free-form text. Use Pydantic models for all agent outputs.
- **Latency matters**: This is a 911 system. Every architectural decision should minimize time-to-dispatch. Prefer streaming over batch processing everywhere.

## When Writing Code for This Project

- Always use **async/await** — the entire system is concurrent (multiple calls, streaming transcripts, parallel agents).
- Use **Pydantic** for all data models (call records, dispatch decisions, briefings).
- Prefer **streaming** LLM responses from Modal when possible.
- All Twilio webhook handlers should be non-blocking.
- Write code that handles partial/incomplete transcripts gracefully — the triage agent will receive incomplete sentences.
- Keep latency top of mind. If there is a faster way to do something, prefer it.
- This is a hackathon — prioritize working features over perfect abstractions. Ship fast, but keep the code readable for a 2-person team.

## Git Workflow

- **Auto-Commit & Push**: At the end of every task or significant change, always offer to or automatically (if confirmed) commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
- Use descriptive, concise commit messages.
- Ensure all changes are staged before committing.
- Always push to the current branch (usually `main` for this hackathon).
